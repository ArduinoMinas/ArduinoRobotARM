# PCA9685-Arduino
Arduino Library for the PCA9685 16-Channel PWM Driver Module.

# VarSpeedServo
The VarSpeedServo.h Arduino library allows the use of up to 8 servos moving asynchronously (because it uses interrupts). In addition, you can set the speed of a move, optionally wait (block) until the servo move is complete, and create sequences of moves that run asynchronously.
